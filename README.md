# CS Fundamentals From Scratch
Learning core computer science fundamentals through simple Python programs.

This repository documents my learning of core computer science concepts
using simple, self-written Python programs.

I focus on understanding fundamentals rather than building complex systems.
Each file contains clear logic and comments explaining my thinking.

This is a learning repository and will be expanded gradually.
